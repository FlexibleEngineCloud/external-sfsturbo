# external-sfsturbo

Scalable File Service (EFS) provides completely hosted sharable file storage for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs)
on Flexible Engine Cloud.
Compatible with the Network File System protocol, EFS is expandable to petabytes, features high performance,
and seamlessly handles data-intensive and bandwidth-intensive applications.

This repository hosts external sfsturbo provisioner for Kubernetes.
